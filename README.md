# Human written vs bot-generated news

This work relates to news classification into the ones written by a human vs the ones generated by a bot. As part of the classification task, we create transition matrix Q for true sentences and use likelihood function in order to estimate the likelihood of a particular sentence being written by a human. We additionally train a shallow neural network to predict the next word in a sentence given current words. 

This work doesn't incorporate all of the details of the final algorithm, and is mostly used for demostration purposes of training shallow neural networks for classification tasks within the space of natural language processing.
